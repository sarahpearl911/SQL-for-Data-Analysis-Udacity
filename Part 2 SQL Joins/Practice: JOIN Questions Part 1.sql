--#1 Provide a table for all web_events associated with account name of Walmart. There should be three columns. Be sure to include the primary_poc, time of the event, and the channel for each event. Additionally, you might choose to add a fourth column to assure only Walmart events were chosen.

SELECT a.primary_poc poc_name, 
       w.occurred_at event_date, 
       w.channel channel, 
       a.name account_name
FROM accounts a
JOIN web_events w
ON a.id = w.account_id
WHERE a.name = 'Walmart'

--#2 Provide a table that provides the region for each sales_rep along with their associated accounts. Your final table should include three columns: the region name, the sales rep name, and the account name. Sort the accounts alphabetically (A-Z) according to account name.

SELECT r.name region_name, 
       s.name rep_name, 
       a.name account_name
FROM accounts a
JOIN sales_reps s
ON a.sales_rep_id = s.id
JOIN region r
ON s.region_id = r.id
ORDER BY account_name

--#3 Provide the name for each region for every order, as well as the account name and the unit price they paid (total_amt_usd/total) for the order. Your final table should have 3 columns: region name, account name, and unit price. A few accounts have 0 for total, so I divided by (total + 0.01) to assure not dividing by zero.

SELECT r.name region_name, 
       a.name account_name, 
       o.total_amt_usd/(o.total + 0.01) unit_price
FROM orders o                              
JOIN accounts a
ON o.account_id = a.id
JOIN sales_reps s
ON a.sales_rep_id = s.id
JOIN region r
ON s.region_id = r.id
